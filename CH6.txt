The while statement
- has the form
  while (expression) statement
- The expression in side the parentheses is the controlling expression and the statement after the parenteses is the loop body

When while statement is executed
- controlling expression is evaluated
- if it is non-zero, then the loop body is executed
- controlling expression is evaluated again until it eventually has the value of zero
--> loop terminates when the controlling expression has the vale of zero
! controlling expression is evaluated before the loop body --> the loop body may not be executed at all

The do statement
- essentially just a while statement whose controlling expression is tested after the loop body is executed
- has the form
  do statement while (expression)
- execution of do statement terminates when the controlling expression has the value of zero after the execution of the loop body
! while 문과 헷갈리기 쉬우므로 항상 statement 를 중괄호로 묶어두는 것이 좋다
