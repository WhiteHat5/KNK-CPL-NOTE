<Program organization>

<Local Variables>
- a variable declared in the body of the function is said to be local
- storage for a local variable is automatically allocated when the funciton is called and deallocated when the function returns
- has block scope (scope: portion of a program text in which the variable can be referenced
  - the varable is visible from its declaration to the end of its enclosing function body

<static local variables>
 - a variable with static storage duration has a permanent storage duration // 프로그램이 종료될 때까지 메모리 자리를 차지함 ㄷㄷ
 - has a form
 static int i;
 - A static local variable still has block scope (not visible to other function)
 * local variable 과 parameter의 다른 점은 parameter가 함수가 시작될 때 입력받은 Argument의 값으로 초기화된다는 것 외에는 없다

<External variables>
